# Hypersite 

This site is built in the style of a 1990 HyperCard stack. HyperCard was a pre-web hypermedia app that came with early Macs. You could build "stacks", which were a little like local-only websites, with "cards" that could be linked together and elements that could be scripted. It was where I first learned to code "useful" things (in 1991 or so) as opposed to messing about with BASIC or Logo, and meant that the web felt very familiar when I first encountered it a few years later.

I was prompted to build this by the considerably more detailed [Wes95](https://wes.dev/) site from Wes Souza.

Design inspiration (and the cursor icon) from [HyperCard Simulator](https://hcsimulator.com/).

The recreated "Chicago" font is [Sysfont](https://fontsarena.com/sysfont-by-alina-sava/) by Alina Sava.

The recreated "Geneva" font is [Geneva 9.1](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1304775/geneva-9) by Kelsey Higham.

This icons and graphics are all originals from HyperCard by Susan Kare, extracted in the [HyperCard Graphics pack](https://egardepe.itch.io/hypercardgraphics).

[Infinite Mac](https://system6.app/) lets you run old versions of Mac OS in your browser. It was useful to remind me how System 6 and HyperCard worked in practice.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build), with zero client-side JavaScript except a snippet on the about page to add some context menu trickery on the profile pic
